# Databases_project
Project in databases by Pascal Schmidt, Philipp Becht and Simon Wrigg

Matriculation Numbers: 8133405, 9443009, 5874903

The group decided to design a database for a gym-chain, which keeps track of their members, trainers, locations, and more. Moreover we built a Python-GUI CRUD-App in order to make entries, updates, deletions and listings of the gym members.
